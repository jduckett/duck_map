Description:

  Synchronizes date/time stamps of all views for a Rails app.

  There are three sources of timestamps for views.

    - The physical timestamp of the view file on disk.

    - The timestamp of the view found in the local Git repo for the app.

    - The last known timestamp already stored in config/locales/sitemaps.yml

  All three sources are compared and the source that has the latest timestamp wins and that value
  
  is stored in config/locales/sitemaps.yml

Example:

  # Performs a synchronization

  rails g duckmap:sync

  # Performs a synchronization and shows all activity

  rails g duckmap:sync --verbose
